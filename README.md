sdl2ui features
===============
SDL2UI can create window GUI applications with UI, buttons, mouse, touch, RFID etc.
SDL2UI is based on SDL1.2 and later SDL2.0

- The graphical renderer from SDL is used to show output on the display
- Images are reponsive when you touch them. A dark background circle when you press them, which decreases fast when released.
- No use of a big SDL_Surface, but each button is a seperate SDL_Surface, more flexible and easier to change to SDL2.0
- 2D matrix of buttons is possible with soft scroll in verticle or horizontal direction.
- After glow for each button, image, background in different shapes.
- Play audio wave forms automatic
- Background for several objects with rounded corners for any radius
- Backgrounds can have single colour
- Backgrounds can have a vertical change gradually from one to another colour
- Backgrounds may have a pyramid change gradually from one to another colour
- Backgrounds may be split in 2 colours, top half and bottom half have another colour
- Backgrounds may cut a piece from a background picture, which requires a background image of your screen resolution.
- Bar graphs are easy to display bar charts
- Button response. Buttons become dark when you press them and slowly become light again when released.
- Buttons with text and image may be created and displayed
- Buttons have a border which is adjustable in width
- Buttons may have a text inside
- Buttons need to align the picture on 8 positions around the text
- Text may be in all colours only 1 colour
- Text can be in any font, font size for arabian and other font and other font size for chinese/japanese.
- Text can have filtering for display or no filtering for printing
- Text can be in a bitmap to do other things than display (e.g. print)
- Text can have a shade
- Buttons can be positioned every 8 pixels and have a width with a multiple of 8 pixels
- Buttons can have a margin between buttons of any number of pixels
- Button text can have a margin of any number of pixels from the edge of a button
- Buttons can be moved to any location
- Buttons can be visibile or invisible
- Buttons may be dragged around the screen if enabled
- Buttons can be in many languages, with an external accessor for languages and text
- Buttons choose the optimal picture size with several pictures on the disk
- Buttons have a background with all posibilities of a background
- CtextButton is derived from button to show text
- CtextButton can reduce the font size automatic until the text fits inside.

- CmatrixButton is derived from button and adjusted for 1D and 2D scrolling
- CgraphButton is derived from button to show a graph

- The handwriter can be used to input Chinese Japanese and others

- The handwriter shows the 50 most look-a-like symbols in a swipe dialog
- The handwriter has thick lines to show

To be continued
===============
The archive is not filled yet with anything. I'm very busy, but want to make this project work... so be a little patience with me.

Soon here will be following objects:
- Buttons : Edit buttons, Text buttons, Keyboard buttons, Bottom buttons, Image buttons
- Images : With backgrounds, rounded rectangles, adjustable gravity, labels
- Sliders
- Swype dialog going up/down or left/right
- 2D swype dialog (matrix)
- Drag and drop, also from swype list
- Dialog solution
- Messagebox solution
- Edit text
- Chinese input method (no, I am not a Chinese)
